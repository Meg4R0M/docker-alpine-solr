Solr 4.10 Docker image for eZ Publish
=====================================

This image runs a 4.10 SOLR server with java 7 installed.
  
The SOLR schema & binaries are the ones provided by ezsystems in [ezfind extension](https://github.com/ezsystems/ezfind/tree/master/java).

This image is therefore intended at being used with eZ Publish 4 or 5.
